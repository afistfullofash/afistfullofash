* afistfullofash's guix channel
This provides the packages used by my [[https://github.com/afistfullofash/guix-config][guix-config]]. These should be eventually upstreamed to either guix or nonguix when I have time to clean up the definitions. External contributions are encouraged.

Add the following to your [[file:~/.config/guix/channels.scm][~/.config/guix/channels.scm]]
#+begin_src scheme
  (channel
     (name 'afistfullofash)
     (url "https://github.com/afistfullofash/afistfullofash")
     (branch "main"))
#+end_src
